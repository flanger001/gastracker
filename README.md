# Gastracker

This is a small Rails app to help myself calculate and keep records of my gas mileage and spending. 

What this app currently has:

+ Landing/dashboard page
+ Instructions on how to use it
+ User authentication
+ Gas entry and station manager

Things I'm working on:

+ Expanding stations and entries to incorporate maintenance stops
+ [D3js](d3js.org) charts for visualization
+ Making a dashboard/profile interface
+ ~~Probably should write some tests I suppose. :-|~~ Friggin did it

It can currently be seen at http://gas.daveshaffer.co.

 If you do steal this and make it your own, make sure you set ENV variables in `.env`! 
 Enjoy!
